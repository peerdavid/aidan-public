# AI Dan

AI Dan uses a few things in order to process your requests:
- First of all there runs a server on google cloud in us-central1 that checks your request and whether you are an android user.
- Your user is not processed, you are only tracked as an anonymous user which helps me to ensure that only android users are accessing my server.
- Finally, to convert your natural text request into a schema, I use VertexAI from google which is also hosted in us-central1
