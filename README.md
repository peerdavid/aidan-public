# Privacy Policy

Nobody is reading long privacy policies. Therefore, I try to keep it short and descriptive. If you want to learn more simply contact me via contact.the.aidan@gmail.com.

AI Dan uses a few things in order to process your requests:
- First of all, your input is either entered via text or voice. 
- To ensure that you are indeed an android user of my app, you are "authenticated" anonymously (I can't see any user, name or email, you are simply a unique id)
- Your request together with your anonymous authentication is then send (via a secure connection) to a server (Google Cloud - us-central1) that processes your request.
- For processing the request, an additional AI is needed which runs on VertexAI from Google which is also hosted in us-central1
- Afterwards, your request is send back via the same connection to your Android device
